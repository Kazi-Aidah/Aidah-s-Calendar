# Aidah's Calendar
A fully customizable, responsive monthly calendar with advanced event management features including drag-and-drop, rich event details, and persistent local storage.

If you're gonna be looking at a Calendar often, then you have a right to have it pretty! The more pleasing to the eye is, the more you want to look at it. And the more you look at your calendar, the more you remember and structure your plans. *Just don't get lost in space while trying to over-customize everything while procrastinating.*

‚ú® Now it features better layouts and ANIMATED EVENT EFFECTS!
# üóìÔ∏è Basic Features
1. **Monthly Calendar View:** Displays a traditional month-by-month calendar.
2. **Month Navigation:** Allows users to navigate to the previous or next month.
3. **"Today" Button:** Quickly returns the calendar view to the current month and day.

4. ‚ú® **Event Management:**
    * **Add Events:** Create new events with a title, optional time, date, optional description, a chosen color, and an icon. Done by pressing on the day cell!
    * **Edit Events:** Modify existing event details.
    * **Delete Events:** Remove events from the calendar.
    * **Drag-and-Drop:** Move events between different dates on the calendar or reorder them within the same day by dragging and dropping.
    * **Drag to Order Events:** For Events with NO TIME inputs, you can drag them above or below other Events!
5. üé® **Customization Options (Settings Modal):**

    * !!! Now allows Day Cell Width Slider.
    * **Custom Font Upload:** Users can upload their own font files (`.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) to personalize the calendar's typography :D
    * **UI Roundness:** Adjust the roundness of various UI elements, including the main container and modal windows.
    * **Event Roundness & Border Thickness:** Customize the appearance of individual event items. (This was super important to me because of inner box design rules!)
    * **Font Size:** Change the overall font size of the application.
    * **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark visual themes.
    * **Pre-made Themes:** Select from a variety of pastel themes (Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Pure Black), each with light and dark variants.

        * **Special Themes:** Unlock additional unique themes like Dracula, Nord, OneDark, etc., by watching ads. (15 Special Themes! Let me know if they need improvements.)
    * **Custom Color Pickers:** Fine-tune individual color aspects of the theme, such as background, text, header, button colors, and more. These are locked by default but unlock forever after watching one ad.

6. **Saving:** All events and user settings are saved locally using `localStorage`, so they persist across browser sessions. That means you can use it in browser too and it'll keep your events saved!
# Best Features
- Allows great levels of customization! (Sharp corners, rounded corners? Adjust the theme colours to your liking? OF COURSE)
- Special Effects & Animated Effects

- Saves in Website too yay

### CONS:
- No device sync.
- No Year/Week/Custom Day View.
- Buttons are stuck in a specific style.

# UPDATES
- I tried to implement Long/Multiday Events and they ended up looking terrible.
- I plan to turn this into an app using Flutter.

    * **Custom Font Upload:** Users can upload their own font files (`.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) to personalize the calendar's typography :D
    * **UI Roundness:** Adjust the roundness of various UI elements, including the main container and modal windows.
    * **Event Roundness & Border Thickness:** Customize the appearance of individual event items. (This was super important to me because of inner box design rules!)

    * **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark visual themes.
    * **Pre-made Themes:** Select from a variety of pastel themes (Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Pure Black), each with light and dark variants.

7. **Persistence:** All events and user settings are saved locally using `localStorage`, so they persist across browser sessions. That means you can use it in browser too and it'll keep your events saved!
